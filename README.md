# Spring Lifecycle

Demo project Spring Boot lifecycle and architecture

## Dependency Injection

### Constructor based

Recommended for Spring and do not need the annotation @Autowired. It helps Unit Tests and force that dependencies are instatiated correctly.

### Setter based

Recommended for non mandatory dependencies.

### Property based

Bad practice.
